# Development environment for creating unofficial Scratch extensions

_Work in progress... come back soon!_

This is a template that I'm creating for my session at the [Raspberry Pi Clubs Conference](https://www.raspberrypi.org/clubs-conference-2023/) later this month!

It will be a workshop for how to create Scratch extensions.

I'll use this repository to provide a template extension and online hosted development environment, so you can create your own Scratch extensions using only a web browser - no local developmnent tools or other software needed.

PS - If you're too impatient to wait, you can see [my current draft instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) but keep in mind that they're not finished yet!
